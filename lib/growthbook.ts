/**
 * GrowthBook configuration for DevPath (client side).
 *
 * Evaluation model:
 *   - The client SDK is bootstrapped with a feature payload fetched on the
 *     SERVER (see `lib/growthbook-server.ts`, cached via `fetch` revalidation)
 *     and the visitor's stable anonymous id (a cookie stamped by
 *     `proxy.ts`). Because the client is initialized with the same
 *     payload + attributes the server used, the first client render matches
 *     the server-rendered HTML — no flag flicker / layout shift.
 *   - Experiment exposure is emitted exactly once per experiment by
 *     `trackingCallback` as `experiment_viewed`.
 *   - Flag usage is emitted at most once per (flag, value) per session by
 *     `onFeatureUsage` — never on every render.
 *
 * Without a client key, GrowthBook runs in "no-network" mode and all flags
 * return their default values, so the app still works out of the box.
